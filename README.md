# Password Generator

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a password generator with multiple different variables included to create secure passwords.
- I built this project to put my knowledge of JavaScript to the test to create a functional and useful application.
- This code creates unique passwords based on several user-selected variables.
- Composing this password generator, I learned many things about JavaScript, such as how to utilize 'if' statements, implement window prompts, returning a list, and 'for' statements.
